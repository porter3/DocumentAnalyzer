# Document Summarizer

### Demo link: https://tinyurl.com/yye8ttla

React front-end / Spring Boot REST API app that takes an uploaded word document, PDF, text file, or pure text and generates a summary using a Python script and the Natural Language Toolkit.
As of now, the UI still needs a little work in terms of responsiveness and styling, but the app is "complete" now (until I decide to add more features).
