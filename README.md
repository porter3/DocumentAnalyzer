# Document Summarizer

*Current focus is working with AWS services to upload files, run the script on them, and complete deployment*

React front-end / Spring Boot REST API app that takes an uploaded word document, PDF, text file, or pure text and generates a summary using a Python script and the Natural Language Toolkit.
As of now, the UI still needs a little work in terms of responsiveness and client-side validation. Server-side validation and proper handling of all files and non-file text works locally.
