# Change Log
Project changes including features, fixes, and refactoring will be documented here using semantic versioning in the format 'MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH' (e.g. v1.0.0). I started this log a bit late into the project, soon after a major API change. Because of that and for the sake of simplicity, the starting version here is 2.0.0.

This log exists so I can get a higher-level view of what I've done instead of looking at specific commit messages, as well as helping anyone interested with the same.
